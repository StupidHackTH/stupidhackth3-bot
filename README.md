stupidhackth3-bot
=================

The Slack bot used in Stupid Hackathon 3.
This bot allows participants and organizers who are all in the Slack workspace to register and manage their team.

- Data is stored inside Airtable to allow easy visualization as well as manual edits.

- All write operations are asynchronous (due to Airtable's API rate limit).
